# Ping Pong

  ### By Taylor Somers

## Description

  This is a website that takes inputted integers from the user and outputs a count of numbers up to and including that integer, following defined JavaScript logic to replace integers with particular divisibility with output "Ping," "Pong,", and "Ping-Pong." It uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery for the actual website build. Most importantly, it is the first example of a website set up with directories and files that actually approximate professional-level organization, complete with essential WebPack plugins.
